# Python Implementation of The Apriori Algorithm

A small personal project I did to implement the apriori algorithm from scratch.

- The utlis file contains all fucntions of the algorithm.
- The Apriori file acts as algorithm, calling all the individual functions.
- The Demo explains the functioning of this implementation with examples.

To run this code format the CSV file **without a header** and only **one transaction per line** for example:
_item1,item2,item3_
_Item1,item2_
_item1,item2,item2,item4_

Fianlly, supply the input filename at the command line:
_python apriori.py input,csv_

_This code requires Python 3 to run_
